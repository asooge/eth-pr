This project was bootstrapped with [Create Eth App](https://github.com/paulrberg/create-eth-app).

## Project Structure

The default template is a monorepo created with [Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/).

Workspaces makes it possible to setup multiple packages in such a way that we only need to run `yarn install` once to install all of them in
a single pass. Dependencies are hoisted at the root.

\*\* react-app is deprecated in favor of next-app found in `packages/interface`

Owing to this dependency on Yarn Workspaces, Create Eth App can't be used with npm.

## Getting Started

In the root directory, you can run:

#### `yarn`: install app dependencies

#### `yarn dev`: run app dev server

#### `yarn format`: format codebase

### Next App: `packages/interface`

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

#### Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

### Subgraph

The Graph is a tool for for indexing events emitted on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides you with an easy-to-use GraphQL API. <br/>

To learn more, check out the [The Graph documentation](https://thegraph.com/docs).

#### `yarn subgraph:codegen`

Generates AssemblyScript types for smart contract ABIs and the subgraph schema.

#### `yarn subgraph:build`

Compiles the subgraph to WebAssembly.

#### `yarn subgraph:auth`

Before deploying your subgraph, you need to sign up on the
[Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer/). There, you will be given an access token. Drop it in the command
below:

```sh
GRAPH_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-access-token-here yarn subgraph:auth
```

#### `yarn subgraph:deploy`

Deploys the subgraph to the official Graph Node.<br/>

Replace `paulrberg/create-eth-app` in the package.json script with your subgraph's name.
